# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes made to resolve the issues you reported:

## 1. Removed Test Credentials from Login Page

### Issue
The login page was showing and pre-filling test credentials (admin@cadcraft.com / admin123) which could be confusing for users.

### Fix
- Removed the "Test Credentials" card from the [Login.tsx](src/pages/Login.tsx) page
- Removed the "Fill Test Credentials" button
- Updated placeholder text to be more generic
- The login page now only shows email and password fields without any pre-filled values

### Files Modified
- [src/pages/Login.tsx](src/pages/Login.tsx)

## 2. Fixed CV Upload Functionality

### Issue
The CV upload feature in the admin dashboard was not working properly:
- Files were not being uploaded successfully
- The homepage still showed "CV Not Available" even after upload attempts
- No visual feedback was provided during upload

### Fixes Made

#### Backend Fixes
1. Updated [backend/src/server.js](backend/src/server.js) to properly configure express-fileupload middleware with additional options:
   - Added `createParentPath: true` to ensure the public directory is created if needed
   - Improved error handling

2. Fixed [backend/src/routes/homepage.js](backend/src/routes/homepage.js) file upload logic:
   - Converted callback-based file move to Promise-based approach for better error handling
   - Improved database update logic to handle both update and insert scenarios
   - Added better error handling and logging

#### Frontend Fixes
1. Updated [src/pages/HomepageEditor.tsx](src/pages/HomepageEditor.tsx) to improve CV upload functionality:
   - Added proper error handling for file uploads
   - Added visual feedback during upload (uploading spinner)
   - Reset file input after successful upload
   - Refresh homepage data after successful upload to show updated CV status
   - Improved error messages

2. Fixed [src/pages/Index.tsx](src/pages/Index.tsx) to properly display CV download button:
   - The button now correctly shows "Download Resume" when CV is available
   - The button is properly styled with blue text when CV is available
   - Added proper link to the uploaded CV file

### Files Modified
- [backend/src/server.js](backend/src/server.js)
- [backend/src/routes/homepage.js](backend/src/routes/homepage.js)
- [src/pages/HomepageEditor.tsx](src/pages/HomepageEditor.tsx)
- [src/pages/Index.tsx](src/pages/Index.tsx)

## 3. Updated Admin Credentials

### Issue
The default admin credentials were not properly configured, making it difficult to log in.

### Fix
- Updated [backend/.env](backend/.env) with proper default credentials:
  - Email: admin@example.com
  - Password: admin123
- Reinitialized the database to apply these credentials

### Files Modified
- [backend/.env](backend/.env)
- Reinitialized database with `node src/scripts/initDatabase.js`

## 4. Improved User Experience

### Additional Improvements
1. Added better error handling throughout the application
2. Improved visual feedback for user actions
3. Fixed database initialization script to use environment variables properly
4. Ensured consistent styling across the application

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Login Page**:
   - Visit the login page at http://localhost:8080/login
   - You should no longer see test credentials or the "Fill Test Credentials" button
   - Use the credentials from [backend/.env](backend/.env) to log in:
     - Email: admin@example.com
     - Password: admin123

2. **CV Upload**:
   - Log in to the admin dashboard
   - Navigate to the Homepage Editor
   - Select a PDF file to upload in the CV Management section
   - You should see a success message and the file should be uploaded
   - Visit the homepage and verify the "Download Resume" button is now functional

3. **Banner Content Editing**:
   - In the Homepage Editor, update the banner content

## Security Notes

1. For production use, make sure to:
   - Change the default admin credentials in [backend/.env](backend/.env)
   - Change the JWT secret in [backend/.env](backend/.env)
   - Use a proper production database instead of SQLite

2. The CV file is stored in the public directory and is publicly accessible via the URL

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Login Issues**:
   - Ensure the database was properly initialized
   - Check that the credentials in [backend/.env](backend/.env) are correct
   - Clear your browser's local storage if you were previously logged in

2. **CV Upload Issues**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the backend server is running
   - Ensure the [backend/public](backend/public) directory exists and is writable
   - Check that you're uploading a PDF file under 10MB

3. **Content Not Updating**:
   - Refresh the page to see changes
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the backend server is running and accessible
